The expression on top is called the numerator.\n        The expression on the bottom is called the denominator.\n        The numerator is divided by the denominator to give you\n        the value of the fraction.  The simplest fractions have just one number\n        on top of another number.  Fractions are a way of expressing division.\n      </h3>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <hr/>\n      <h1 className='large-left-margin'>\n        Parts of a Whole\n      </h1>\n      <h3 className=\"heading\">\n        A fraction can be thought of as being a number of equal parts of a whole.\n        The denominator says how many pieces the whole is divided into.  Once you know \n        from the denominator how many pieces the whole has been divided into, you can \n        look at the numerator to see how many of them you have.  For example, if you divide\n        a loaf of bread into 16 equal slices, the denominator is 16.  If you have 3 of these 16 \n        slices, the numerator is 3.  Fractions can describe less than a whole, 1 whole, \n        greater than a whole, zero out of a whole, or even a negative amount of a whole.\n      </h3>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <hr/>\n      <h1 className='large-left-margin'>\n        Their Form\n      </h1>\n      <h3 className='heading'>\n        A fraction looks like this:\n      </h3>\n      <MathJax.Provider input=\"tex\">\n        <MathJax.Node className='heading' formula={`\\\\color{white}{\\\\frac{\\\\textrm{numerator}}{\\\\textrm{denominator}}}`}></MathJax.Node>\n      </MathJax.Provider>\n      <h3 className='heading'>\n        For example, if you divide a loaf of bread into 12 equal slices, and you take 2 slices,\n        you have 2 twelfths of the loaf.  The numerator is how many you have, and it is 2, \n        and the denominator many part of a loaf the bread has been divided into, \n        and it is 12.

The result of any number other than 0 divided by 0\n        is undefined, as to divide a number you must find the number that you multiply\n        that number by to get the original number and 0 times any number is 0, so the only\n        number we can get is 0.  For example, if we divide 5 by 0, we are asking what number\n        times 0 equals 5.  Therefore, we say that 5 over 0 is \n        undefined.  This is true for all numbers divide by 0 except 0.  Unless the \n        numerator is 0, no 0 denominator can multiply by a number to\n        equal the numerator, so we cannot find a number for the value of the fraction so\n        we say the fraction is undefined.\n      </h3>\n      <h3 className=\"heading\">\n        In the case of 0 for the numerator with 0 for the denominator, until we have \n        more information we don't know what the value of the fraction is, as any \n        number times 0 is 0.  Mathematicians say that 0 over 0 without more \n        information is indeterminate.\n      </h3>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <hr/>\n      <h1 className='large-left-margin'>\n        Fractions' Value\n      </h1>\n      <h3 className=\"heading\">\n        The numerator can be smaller than the denominator, greater than the denominator,\n        or equal to the denominator.  When the numerator is equal to the denominator \n        but is not 0 over 0,\n        the division comes out to one, so the value of the fraction is one.\n      </h3>\n      <h3 className=\"heading\">\n        If we do not take into account negative signs, as the denominator\n        grows, the number shrinks, and as the numerator grows, the number grows.\n        If we ignore negative signs, and have a non-zero denominator,\n        if the numerator is less than the denominator, the\n        fraction is less than one, if they are equal, the fraction is one, and \n        if it is greater, the fraction is greater than one.  For example, 11 \n        twelfths is less than 1, as 11 is less than the number needed to have a whole,\n        which is 12.  12 twelfths is exactly 1, as you have all the parts that make \n        up the whole.  15 twelfths is greater than 1 but less than 2.\n      </h3>\n      <h3 className=\"heading\">\n        Aside from 0 over 0, if the numerator divided by the denominator is a \n        number with nothing after the decimal point, then the numerator is a \n        multiple of the denominator and the fraction can be written as a number \n        that is not a fraction and has no decimal point.  In other words, it \n        can be written as an integer.  For example, 24 twelfths is \n        exactly 2, as the numerator divided by the denominator works out to 2, so you \n        have 2 wholes.\n      </h3>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <hr/>\n      <h1 className='large-left-margin'>\n        What Next?\n      </h1>\n      <h3 className=\"heading\">\n        Try some problems in the teachings to start learning fractions.\n      </h3>\n    </span>\n  )\n}\nexport default AboutFraction"],"sourceRoot":""}
