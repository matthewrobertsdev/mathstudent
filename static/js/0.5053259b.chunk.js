Fractions have two mathematical expressions on top of each other, separated by a horizontal bar.  The expression on top is called the numerator. The expression on the bottom is called the denominator. The numerator is divided by the denominator to give you the value of the fraction.  The simplest fractions have just one number on top of another number.  Fractions are a way of expressing division."),o.a.createElement("h1",{className:"large-left-margin"},"Parts of a Whole"),o.a.createElement("h3",{className:"heading"},"A fraction can be thought of as being a number of equal parts of a whole. The denominator says how many pieces the whole is divided into.  Once you know from the denominator how many pieces the whole has been divided into, you can look at the numerator to see how many of them you have.  For example, if you divide a loaf of bread into 16 equal slices, the denominator is 16.  If you have 3 of these 16 slices, the numerator is 3.  Fractions can describe less than a whole, 1 whole, greater than a whole, zero out of a whole, or even a negative amount of a whole."),o.a.createElement("h1",{className:"large-left-margin"},"Their Form"),o.a.createElement("h3",{className:"heading"},"A fraction looks like this:"),o.a.createElement(r.a.Provider,{input:"tex"},o.a.createElement(r.a.Node,{className:"heading",formula:"\\color{white}{\\frac{\\textrm{numerator}}{\\textrm{denominator}}}"})),o.a.createElement("h3",{className:"heading"},"For example, if you divide a loaf of bread into 12 equal slices, and you take 2 slices, you have 2 twelfths of the loaf.

The result of any number other than 0 divided by 0 is undefined, as to divide a number you must find the number that you multiply that number by to get the original number and 0 times any number is 0, so the only number we can get is 0.  For example, if we divide 5 by 0, we are asking what number times 0 equals 5.  Therefore, we say that 5 over 0 is undefined.  This is true for all numbers divide by 0 except 0.

For example, 11 twelfths is less than 1, as 11 is less than the number needed to have a whole, which is 12.  12 twelfths is exactly 1, as you have all the parts that make up the whole.  15 twelfths is greater than 1 but less than 2."),o.a.createElement("h3",{className:"heading"},"Aside from 0 over 0, if the numerator divided by the denominator is a number with nothing after the decimal point, then the numerator is a multiple of the denominator and the fraction can be written as a number that is not a fraction and has no decimal point.
